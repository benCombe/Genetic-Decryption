Born in Bonn, Beethoven displayed his musical talent at a young age. 
He was initially taught intensively by his father, Johann van 
Beethoven, and later by Christian Gottlob Neefe. Under Neefe's 
tutelage in 1783, he published his first work, a set of keyboard 
variations. He found relief from a dysfunctional home life with the 
family of Helene von Breuning, whose children he loved, befriended, 
and taught piano. At age 21, he moved to Vienna, which subsequently 
became his base, and studied composition with Haydn. Beethoven then 
gained a reputation as a virtuoso pianist, and was soon patronised by 
Karl Alois, Prince Lichnowsky for compositions, which resulted in his 
three Opus 1 piano trios (the earliest works to which he accorded an 
opus number) in 1795.
