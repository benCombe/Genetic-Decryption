With the increase in his reputation, Haydn eventually obtained 
aristocratic patronage, crucial for the career of a composer 
in his day. Countess Thun, having seen one of Haydn's 
compositions, summoned him and engaged him as her singing and 
keyboard teacher. In 1756, Baron Carl Josef Furnberg employed 
Haydn at his country estate, Weinzierl, where the composer wrote 
his first string quartets. Of them, Philip G. Downs said "they 
abound in novel effects and instrumental combinations that can 
only be the result of humorous intent". Their enthusiastic 
reception encouraged Haydn to write more. It was a turning point 
in his career. As a result of the performances, he became in 
great demand both as a performer and a teacher. Furnberg later 
recommended Haydn to Count Morzin, who, in 1757, became his 
first full-time employer. His salary was a respectable 200 
florins a year, plus free board and lodging.
