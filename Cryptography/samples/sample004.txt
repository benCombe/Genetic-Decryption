Originally called Olorin, he was accounted as the wisest of the Maiar. 
He was created by Ilúvatar before the Music of the Ainur, and was at 
the beginning of Time amongst the Ainur who entered into Ea. In his 
"youth" he became one of the Maiar who served Manwë, Varda, Irmo, and 
Nienna. He was associated with light and fire, much like Varda, yet 
his ways often took him to Nienna, from whom he learned pity and 
patience. He loved the Elves, but walked unseen among them, or wore 
the guise of an Elf, and sent them fair visions in their hearts that 
made them wiser. Throughout his life he followed the example of Nienna, 
talking pity on the sorrows of the Children of Ilúvatar and drawing those 
who listened to him out of despair.
