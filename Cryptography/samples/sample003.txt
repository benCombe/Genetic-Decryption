Following the creation, the fourteen Valar dwelt first on Almaren, 
a hidden island on the Great Lake, but, after it was destroyed 
and the earth was reshaped, long before the Awakening of the Elves, 
they relocated to Aman and founded the realm of Valinor. They 
would become known as the 'Powers of the World', though rarely 
directly intervening in the world's course of events. Eru instead 
gave them delegation of Arda, and so at Valinor they constructed 
the golden city of Valimar, their own mansions dispersed across 
the plain; and Mahanaxar, the "Ring of Doom", at which they would 
confer and hold counsels.
